# Markov State Models for capsid assembly around RNA

## Overview
I've used to Markov State Models (MSMs) to study the self-assembly of viral capsids around RNA.  I deployed these models on the high-performance computer clusters at Brandeis University using GPUs.  These MSMs typically ran 10x faster than brute-force simulations; I'm afraid I can only share a few of the scripts from this simulation.
